#Workation Price Prediction: Machine Learning for Smart Travel Planning
This project predicts Per Person Price for workation trips using machine learning.
The dataset (21,000 train, 9,000 test) includes features like destination, package type, hotel details, and itinerary.
Preprocessing involved handling missing values, feature extraction (places covered, sightseeing spots, flight stops), date transformation, and categorical encoding.
A Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBM) was trained for price prediction, with results saved for evaluation. 
Future enhancements include hyperparameter tuning and stacking models for improved accuracy.
